useEffect

useEffect hook is part of React’s Hooks API. The core principle of this hook is to let you perform side effects in your functional components. The useEffect hook is a smooth combination of React’s lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount. According to React documentation, the useEffect hook was developed to overcome some challenges posed by the life cycle methods of ES6 class components.
