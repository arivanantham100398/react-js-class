React is a frontend javascript library 

Free & Open Source
It is maintained by meta community
Web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript
component-based front end library 
React is a declarative
We write the code that we want and React is in charge of taking our declared code and performing all of the JavaScript/DOM steps to get us to our desired result.
React is js library use of developing SPA
React uses Virtual DOM & and it's basically component base approach
Virtual DOM - Light representation of real DOM in memory - When state of an object changes Virtual DOM changes the object in real DOM, it doesn't update all the state of objects
Virtual DOM - is faster, no memory wastage, can't update HTML directly, 


SPA - Single Page Application

A SPA is an app that works inside a browser and does not require page reloading during use

MPA

Multiple-page applications work in a “traditional” way. Every change eg. display the data or submit data back to server requests rendering a new page from the server in the browser

Component

Components are reusable anywhere within the application. It will be a good idea to create a component if you are planning to reuse the component multiple times in different parts of the project.

JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React

JS Vs JSX

JS is standard javascript, JSX is an HTML-like syntax that you can use with React to (theoretically) make it easier and more intuitive to create React components

JSX Rules 

Return Single Element.
div/section/article or React Fragment.
Use camelCase for HTML Attribute.
className Instead of Class.
Close Every Element.
Formatting.
Tags are elements.
